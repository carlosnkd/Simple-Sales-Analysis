# [Simple Sales Analysis](https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks/tree/master/SalesAnalysis/Sales_Data)

In this dataset I use some classic libraries to make the analysis (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc...) for the 12 months.
The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronic store purchases on the US broken by date, product, cost, etc...
 
### Process that I follow:
#### Clean the data
* Extract the data and merge it to a single file

#### Try to respond to a few simple business questions
* Best month for sales
* Sales along the years
* Sales quantity along the years
* Best sales week day
* Best cities and states performance
* Which products are sold the most together (pairs and groups of 3)

#### If necessary extract more info from the columns in order to answer those questions
* Feature Engineering
* Get more info from the data column (date, hour, week day, month name, etc...)

#### Plot the results ahd keep digging 
* Sales vs quantity sold per product
